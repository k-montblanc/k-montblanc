Hi, my name is Kyle Mont Blanc and I work as an instructional technology coach for a large, metro school district.

I am currently learning Javascript and web development. 

At my job I see a constant need for additional functionality to certain Google products. My goal is to have a better understanding of Javascript and Google Apps script to get my teachers the functionality they need.
